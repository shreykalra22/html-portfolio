<h1>The Best Movies According to Shrey</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Dunki</h3>
<p>When an ailing Manu (Taapsee Pannu) wants to return to India, she realises Hardayal Singh Dhillon aka Hardy is the only one who can help her come back to the country she left years back in search of better prospects.</p>
<h3>Joram</h3>
<p> Here’s a movie where you need just a few minutes of viewing to know that you’re in for an intriguing and intense watch along with a stellar performance by its lead, Manoj Bajpayee, who plays Dasru Karketta/Bala. The first instance he appears on the screen, squatting on the floor under the open sky, you are convinced he’s a tribal rooted in culture. He gets the look (with face tattoos) and the demeanour perfectly and has a tight grip on it until the end and through the different phases of his rich character arc</p>
<h3>12th Fail</h3>
<p>Clearing the coveted Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) exams is not for the weak, whether in academics or conviction. This makes Manoj Kumar Sharma's (Vikrant Massey) story extraordinary. The boy from a village in Chambal, Madhya Pradesh, flunks his 12th exams after the new DPS, Dushyant Singh (Priyanshu Chatterjee), prevents the teachers from enabling students to cheat in the 'borad' (board) exams. Manoj clears the following year in the third division and reaches Delhi to appear for the Civil Services examination. He has the fire but not the academic acumen to make it, so much so that he's not even aware there's such a thing as the UPSC or the IPS profile. The story follows Manoj and how he juggles menial jobs to survive while realising his dream, with his mentor (Anshumaan Pushkar), friends, and girlfriend Shraddha Joshi's (Medha Shankar) support.</p>
